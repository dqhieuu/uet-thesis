\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

The system and methodologies exhibit encouraging outcomes within the domain of 3D avatar reconstruction, demonstrating potential applicability in diverse fields such as 3D animation and 3D character creation. 

Further enhancements to the system, including the incorporation of additional features, can potentially elevate its level of customization and usability. More recent approaches in the field of 3D avatar reconstruction such as \glsxtrshort{nerf} could be integrated into the system to improve the quality of the 3D avatar model. The system could also be extended to support the reconstruction of 3D avatars from multiple-view images.
