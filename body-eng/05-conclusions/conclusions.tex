\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

\subsection{Conclusions}

The system and methodologies in this thesis exhibit encouraging outcomes within the domain of 3D avatar reconstruction, demonstrating potential applicability in diverse fields such as 3D animation and 3D character creation.

Part of this thesis is presented in the form of a research paper, which has been submitted to the \textit{International Conference on Advances in Information and Communication Technology} 2023 and has been accepted. The paper is titled \textit{``InstaFace: Single-view 3D Face Reconstruction with Hair Try-on''}. 

\subsection{Future work}

Further enhancements to the system, including the incorporation of additional features, can potentially elevate its level of customization and usability. More recent approaches in the field of 3D avatar reconstruction such as \glsxtrshort{nerf} or \glsxtrshort{gan} could be integrated into the system to improve the quality of the 3D avatar model. The system could also be extended to support the reconstruction of 3D avatars from multiple-view images, which would allow for the generation of more accurate 3D avatar models.
